# **Beginner-friendly resources for Machine Learning**

A traditional program is a set of instructions that we provide to a machine in order to perform a specific task. On the other hand, Machine Learning is quite different and unique. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where a machine has the ability to learn and improve itself from experience without being programmed explicitly by anyone. Machine Learning is in a stage of booming and there is a lot of interesting research work going on. Everyone wants to understand it and break into AI for utilizing its power. Unfortunately, it is often perceived as a miraculous black box that takes some input data and gives out magical predictions but it has got so much more to it than that. Students and developers from various traits and fields want to start using Machine Learning in their projects but the important question is,

&quot;_Where do I begin with Machine Learning?&quot;_

Breaking into this field is not a task of a few days but a lot of resources today have made it easier for beginners to get a head start. Today, you don&#39;t need to be enrolled in a Ph.D. program or you don&#39;t even need to be doing a Computer Science degree for being able to learn about this new technology. Regardless of the background, you have various options to get started with ML. In this article, we will go over some of the best beginner-friendly resources for Machine Learning.

Before getting straight into it, you should know that there are basically various paths that you can take to get into ML and AI. There is a top-down approach where you just learn high-level things in brief and focus on implementations using frameworks like TensorFlow and Pytorch[we will talk about these frameworks later in the article]. The other approach is that you focus on every algorithm and all the maths and statistics behind it. The latter approach is most beneficial for people who want to get into the research domain of AI and ML. Identify the one that suits you better.

According to me, a top-down approach is better for most of the beginners who want to break into AI and ML and start working on their projects. In this approach, you can learn the mathematics behind it as and when you need it. Here you can directly experience the practical working and this keeps you motivated to keep learning. Whereas one might lose their interest if they just keep learning the theory of ML and not use it anywhere. One important point to keep in mind is that in this approach, people tend to skip the perception part and just copy-paste some code from the internet or courses. The code will work but it is necessary to understand the intuition and reasoning behind it. You must know the reason for every line of code that you write.

If you want to start with a top-down approach, then there are many great resources available for free on the internet. The most common question that I get from people is, &quot;I&#39;ve done Python. Now, how do I start with ML?&quot; My answer to that is a series of steps that I&#39;ll go over in this article. If you have the knowledge of Python language then that is great because it has a great pool of Machine Learning libraries that makes it one of the best languages for ML. But if you don&#39;t know anything about this language, don&#39;t be demotivated. It is one of the simplest programming languages to learn.
